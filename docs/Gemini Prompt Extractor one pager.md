### **The Problem: Information Overload & Dispersed Content** üò©

In today's web-centric world, users are constantly bombarded with information. When researching, reading, or just Browse, key details are often:

- **Buried** within lengthy articles.
    
- **Scattered** across multiple tabs, leading to tab fatigue.
    
- **Distracting**, surrounded by ads and irrelevant elements.
    
- **Difficult to save** or revisit without bookmarking entire pages.
    

This leads to reduced productivity and a fragmented information consumption experience.

### **The Solution: Intelligent Content Snippets, Sidebar Delivery** ‚ú®

Our Chrome extension feature will offer a seamless way to **extract core content** from the active webpage and present it clearly in a dedicated side panel.

**Core Functionality:**

1. **Toolbar-Triggered Extraction**: When the action icon on the toolbar is clicked, the side panel will open and immediately trigger the content extraction from the DOM of the active page.
    
2. **Smart Query Capture**: The extraction function will intelligently capture conversation queries or prompts, isolating them from surrounding dialogue.
    
3. **Clean Side Panel Display**: Present the extracted content in a minimalist, readable format within the Chrome side panel.
    
4. **Persistent Access**: Content remains accessible in the side panel even as the user navigates other tabs, providing a continuous reference.

### **How We'll Build It: A Developer's Snapshot** üõ†Ô∏è

Developing this feature involves a blend of web technologies and intelligent content processing:

- **Manifest V3**: Adhering to Chrome's latest extension manifest for enhanced security and performance.
    
- **Content Scripts**: Injecting JavaScript into webpages to interact with the DOM and extract information.
    
- **Background Script/Service Worker**: Handling the communication between the content script and the side panel, managing data, and potentially running lightweight processing.
    
- **Side Panel API**: Utilizing Chrome's dedicated API to create a persistent and responsive UI for displaying extracted content.
    
- **DOM Parsing & Readability Algorithms**: On the technical side, we'll employ robust DOM manipulation to strip away extraneous elements and focus on the core article.
    
- **UI/UX**: Prioritizing a clean, intuitive interface using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the side panel.

# **Project Requirements Document: Chrome Extension - Side Panel Content Extractor**

## **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the project requirements for a Chrome extension that intelligently extracts and displays content from webpages in the browser's side panel. The goal is to provide users with a focused and organized way to consume information without the clutter of traditional web browsing.

## **2. The Problem: Information Overload & Dispersed Content**

Users today face significant challenges when consuming information online:

- **Information is Buried**: Key details are often hidden within long articles, requiring significant time to locate.
- **Content is Scattered**: Research and reading frequently involve juggling multiple tabs, leading to a fragmented and distracting experience.
- **Distractions are Prevalent**: Ads, pop-ups, and irrelevant content surround the information users actually want.
- **Saving is Cumbersome**: Bookmarking entire pages is often overkill when only a snippet of information is needed.

This results in reduced productivity, difficulty in focusing, and a generally poor user experience.

## **3. The Solution: Intelligent Content Snippets, Sidebar Delivery**

We will develop a Chrome extension that provides a seamless way to extract the core content from any active webpage and present it in a clean, dedicated side panel. This allows for persistent access to important information while continuing to browse.

## **4. Core Features**

### **4.1. Toolbar-Triggered Extraction**
- **Description**: A user can click an icon in the Chrome toolbar to open the extension's side panel.
- **Action**: Upon clicking, the side panel will open, and the content extraction process will be initiated on the currently active webpage.

### **4.2. Smart Query Capture**
- **Description**: The extension will be able to identify and extract specific "prompts" or "queries" from conversational content.
- **Implementation**: This will involve DOM analysis to identify patterns that indicate a query, such as specific HTML tags or class names.

### **4.3. Clean Side Panel Display**
- **Description**: The extracted content will be presented in a minimalist, readable format within the side panel.
- **UI/UX**: The design will prioritize readability and a clean interface, free of the source page's clutter.

### **4.4. Persistent Access**
- **Description**: The content in the side panel will remain visible and accessible even when the user navigates to other tabs or windows.
- **Benefit**: This provides a constant reference point without needing to switch back to the original source tab.

## **5. Technical Snapshot**

The extension will be built using modern web technologies and Chrome extension APIs:

- **Manifest V3**: The extension will adhere to Chrome's latest manifest version for improved security, performance, and a longer support window.
- **Content Scripts**: JavaScript will be injected into webpages to access and parse the DOM.
- **Background Script (Service Worker)**: A service worker will manage communication between the content script and the side panel, handle data, and perform any necessary background processing.
- **Side Panel API**: Chrome's dedicated Side Panel API will be used to create and manage the side panel UI.
- **DOM Parsing**: Robust DOM manipulation techniques will be used to identify and extract the main content of a page, stripping away ads, navigation, and other non-essential elements.
- **UI/UX**: The side panel will be built with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a lightweight and responsive experience.

## **6. User Benefits**

- **Enhanced Focus**: By isolating key information, the extension will help users concentrate on what's important.
- **Improved Productivity**: Quick access to reference material without tab switching will streamline research and reading workflows.
- **Effortless Information Clipping**: A simple way to save and refer to important snippets of information.
- **Streamlined Research**: Users can keep relevant data in view while exploring related topics in other tabs.

## **7. Future Enhancements**

While the initial version will focus on the core features, future releases could include:

- **Customizable Views**: Allow users to adjust font sizes, color themes, and other display settings.
- **Content Summarization**: Integrate a summarization engine to provide even more concise versions of extracted content.
- **History and Collections**: Allow users to save and organize extracted snippets into collections for later reference.
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Sync saved snippets across a user's devices.
- **Export Options**: Allow users to export snippets to other applications like note-taking apps or document editors.
